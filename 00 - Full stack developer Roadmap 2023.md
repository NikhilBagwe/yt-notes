## Communication Protocols :

- It is a protocol which computer systems need to follow when they need to communicate which each other.
- A protocol is a set of defined rules.
- There are 2 important types of protocols.

### Transport Layer protocols : TCP and UDP

- Get a high level overview of this topics
- In TCP, when machine A tries talking with another machine B and there is a network discrepancy, the machine A will keep sending messages until it is able to create a connection. Eg: Instagram login
- In UDP, machine A will just keep throwing messages/packets to machine B and if machine B dosen't accepts it, there is no acknowledgement from the server to tell that he machine B has received message. Eg: Live streaming, Zoom call where we miss some parts of the video still it's not a big problem.
